Lazarus is a Delphi compatible cross-platform IDE for Rapid Application Development. 
It has variety of components ready for use and a graphical form designer to easily create complex graphical user interfaces.


## History
Lazarus was started in February of 1999. It was primarily founded by three individuals:

* Cliff Baeseman
* Shane Miller
* Michael A. Hess

All three had attempted to get involved with the Megido project which dissolved. In frustration they started the Lazarus project. It has had a steady growth of supporters and developers during the following years. The founders are not involved with the project any more.

The next oldest member of the team is Marc Weustink. He got involved with the project in Aug. 1999. Following him is Mattias Gaertner who got involved in Sept. 2000. Both of them have been the major contributors to the core of what makes Lazarus tick
